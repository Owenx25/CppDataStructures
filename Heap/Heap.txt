Heap
======
- tree-based data structure that follows the heap property
	- The key stored in each node is >=(Max heap) or <=(min heap) to its children
- Can be implemented with pointers but Array is mush more efficient/common
- With array:
	- Nodes are located at 2n where n = node index
	- Left child located at 2n + 1
	- Right child located at 2n + 2
	- elements out of order are simply swapped up into order


Variants:
- Binary Heap
	- All levels of tree except bottom are completely filled
	- The key stored in each node is >=(Max heap) or <=(min heap) to its children
