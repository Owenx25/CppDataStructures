Hash Map
=========
- An array where any type of key can be mapped to any type of value using
  a hash function
  
 ex. HashMap map
	 Hash("One") --> 0
	 Hash("Four") --> 3
	 Hash("Of") --> 3
	Key               Index    Data
	===               =====    ====
	"One"               0      "UNO" -> NULL
	"Two", "Seven"      1      "DOS" -> "SEIS" -> NULL
	"Three"             2      "TRES" -> NULL
	"Four", "Of"        3      "CUATRO" -> "DE" -> NULL
	"Five"              4      NULL
	
	map["One"] --> "UNO"
	map["Two"] --> "DOS"
	map["Four"] --> "CUATRO"
	map["Seven"] --> "SEIS"

- Storing and Indexing very quick O(1)
- Only trouble comes from collisions
	- A collision is when more the hash function returns the same index as another key in the table
	- There are many ways of dealing with this, the most common is to put a linked list at each
	  location in the map array
- A hash table is only as strong as its hash function, generally you want a hash function
  with uniform distribution, meaning most inputs have a unique output
- As the buckets get larger in a hash table, the search time increases
