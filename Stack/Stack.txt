- A vertical representation of data where all interactions are based around the "top" element
	- PUSH adds a new element to the top, covering the old top
	- PEEK returns the current element at the top
	- POP removes the top element and returns it
- Also referred to as Last In, First Out or LIFO
- Can be Implemented with Array or Linked List
	- It seems better with a LL because inserts/deletions at the head are O(1) and list is unbounded
- Commonly used to allocate and access memory
- can also be used for back tracking
