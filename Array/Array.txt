Array
======
- Ex. 
Data:    [1, 2, 3, 4]
Index:    0  1  2  3

- Arrays are used for tons of different operations and the creation of other data structures
- An array represents a continuous block of memory, each "cell" takes up a certain amount of memory
- Each cell can be accessed by an "index" which may start at 0 or 1 and refers to the ith element


Regular Array vs. Dynamic:
- Dynamic arrays have the ability to grow and shrink outside of their initialized bounds
- This makes operations like insert/delete possible but are slower compared to linked lists(O(n) vs O(1))

Efficiency:
- Indexing an array takes O(1) time since only a small calculation is needed to get the memory address

When to Use:
- Arrays are best used when you have large sets of data that you are primarily ACCESSING elements
- DON'T use arrays when you have a data set with many INSERTIONS or DELETIONS
	- this is because shifting elements is needed for these operations which takes O(n) time
